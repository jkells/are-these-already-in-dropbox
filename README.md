#Are these files already in DropBox

This is just a really hacky Windows Forms app for comparing two folders to check if all the files in one have been copied somehwere in the other.

I use it when copying photos into DropBox. I only want to copy files that aren't already there and I need to use a hash because the DropBox camera upload changes the filename...
